# Challenge Creating a .Net API (TMDB)

Endpoints
1 Create new user - Saves it into the Entity Framework DB Memory
2 Authenticate user - Returns 200 if the credentials are Ok, if not a BadRequest (401)
3 Search By Title - Pre requisite is that the user needs to be authenticated if not an authorized is returned
4 Save/Update Preferences - Saves the Preferences to be used later as a Filter for other endpoints
